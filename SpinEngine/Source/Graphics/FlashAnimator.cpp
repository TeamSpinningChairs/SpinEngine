//Export flash data to XML, convert XML to JSON
//Factory startup, ObjectData loads & parses all animation files in master.json
//(you will specify the file *and* individual animation names to look for in master.json)
//On construction, ask global factory accessor for animation data relating to our animation name
//Get that data, use it as needed.
//This should be just as complex as required to support both further flash animations and reuse
//of any individual animation's data (since there'll be up to four players)
